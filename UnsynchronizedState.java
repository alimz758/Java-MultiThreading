// Implement a new class UnsynchronizedState, which is implemented just like SynchronizedState except that it does not use the keyword synchronized in 
// its implementation. Put the implementation into a new file UnsynchronizedState.java.

class UnsynchronizedState implements State {
    //array of longs
    //Each array entry starts at zero
    private long[] value;

    UnsynchronizedState(int length) { value = new long[length]; }

    public int size() { return value.length; }

    public long[] current() { return value; }
    // A state transition, called a swap, consists of subtracting 1 from one of the entries, and adding 1 to an entry â€“ 
    // typically a different entry although the two entries can be the same in which case a swap does nothing.
    public void swap(int i, int j) {
        //i and j could be same
        value[i]--;
        value[j]++;
    }
    // --------------   END RESULT---------:
    // The sum of all the array entries should therefore remain zero; if it becomes nonzero, that indicates that one or more transitions weren't done correctly.
